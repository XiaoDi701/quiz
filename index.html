        What kind of community is the “OC” scene, really? A lot of people see it as something childish—like having imaginary friends.
        But I don’t think it’s something only kids can do. If you think about it in a broader sense, characters like Hamlet or
        Romeo and Juliet were Shakespeare’s OCs. To me, OC creation is a form of storytelling, world-building, and self-expression.
        Often, when we create OCs, we draw inspiration from ourselves or the people around us. With this test, I want to encourage
        people to take OCs more seriously—by using a fun, playful format to highlight the thought and care that goes into them.
