This is a small web quiz I made called "Which OC of mine are you most similar to?" You’ll answer 10 multiple-choice questions, and at the end, the system will match you with one of my original characters (OCs), along with their picture and a bit of backstory.

I created this as a fun and easy way to help people understand that there's actually a lot of thought and emotional depth behind OCs. On the technical side, I built it using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also experimented with some interactive design—like using localStorage to save your progress (so even if you refresh the page, your answers don’t disappear). On the result page, the background, color scheme, and character story all change depending on which OC you get. There’s also an “About this quiz” button at the bottom, which expands to show my thoughts on OC creation.

The hardest part was definitely getting the “About” button and save function to work. The logic looked simple at first, but honestly, it felt like swallowing an electric lightbulb—easy to get in, hard to get out, and the more I touched it, the more stuck it got. In the end, I debugged everything bit by bit. If I had more time, I’d love to add a “go back to the previous question” feature, and maybe even more animations, sound effects, or voice lines from the characters to make the experience feel more complete.
